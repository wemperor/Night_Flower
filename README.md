It´s a printed flower that opens in the dark and shines bright.

To print it, go to the awesome thing by emmet at thingiverse: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:37926

To make it running like in the video, you need to tinker together:
-any kind of Arduino
-a Servo
-a photodiode or any type of light sensor
-some LED´s
-and a power source

Depending on the light sensor you use, you might have to adapt the sketch.

There are no drawings for the base plate, but if you can print the flower, you definitely have the tools and skills to make a good baseplate on your own ;)
